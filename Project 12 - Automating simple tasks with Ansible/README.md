# Ansible - Automating simple tasks with Ansible

Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool that is commonly used in DevOps practices for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It simplifies complex tasks, enables infrastructure as code (IaC), and promotes consistency across environments. Here are some frequently use cases for ansible by DevOps Engineers:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Ansible allows you to define your infrastructure in a declarative manner using YAML files, which are easy to read and understand. In addition to creating and defining infrastructures, the state of these infrastructures can also be managed by ansible.
2. **Configuration Management:** Ansible helps in managing the configuration of servers and infrastructure components.
3. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks:** DevOps involves a lot of repetitive tasks like software deployments, updates, and system configurations. Ansible playbooks can automate these tasks, reducing the risk of human error and saving time.
4. **Application Deployment:** Ansible can be used to automate the deployment of applications, ensuring consistency across different environments. Ansible playbooks can be written to deploy applications, update configurations, and handle other deployment-related tasks.

This would be a basic introduction to ansible where we will start by installing ansible, and then create playbooks to automate simple tasks. Let's begin.
